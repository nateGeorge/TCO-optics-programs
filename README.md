# TCO-optics-programs

This is a collection of software written to automate data collection, analysis, and other functions for the TCO sputtering proccess 
at NuvoSun. 
  
The optics data viewers are made to load data stored in a database, and plot it in a nice readable way.  A demo of the plot is 
included (demo data plot.png). 
  
'export optics data.py' is used to export the raw data being viewed in the data viewer. 
  
'export IR0 IR1 - 3D.py' collects raw reflectance spectra that has been measured, grabs the web length data with 
time from an excel file, and combines all of that to make a contour plot of the raw reflectance data by the 
measured length from the excel file.  
Some demos are given as 'IRx countor demo.png'.
